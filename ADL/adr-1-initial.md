# Architecture Decision Record: Use ADL in project

## Status

accepted

## Context

We want to document any architectural changes in ADR file.

## Decision

Use Markdowan ADR files in ADL folder. This is initial structure with Title, Status, Decision and Consequences.

ADL will be stored in GIT repository and we use Conventional Commits.

Allowed statuses: proposed, accepted, rejected, deprecated, superseded.

## Consequences

After change the architecture the developers or architect should add new ADR in to ADL.
Of course we use Code Review for arch commits.
